# Student Grade Calculator

A Java-based application to calculate student grades based on marks obtained in various subjects. This project features both a simple **Command Line Interface (CLI)** and a modern, **Animated Graphical User Interface (GUI)**.

## Features

-   **Dynamic Subject Entry**: Add as many subjects as needed.
-   **Robust Input Handling**: Validates user input to ensure marks are between 0 and 100.
-   **Automated Calculations**: Instantly computes Total Marks, Average Percentage, and Grade.
-   **Animated GUI**:
    -   Score "count-up" animation for a premium feel.
    -   Interactive button hover effects.
    -   Clean, modern Swing-based design.

## Prerequisites

-   **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or higher.
